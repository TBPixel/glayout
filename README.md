# GLayout

Garry's Mod Library for building HUD's using grids

## Roadmap

* ~~0.1.1 - Box Model's~~

    * ~~Re-Write the Box Model System to be more functional~~

* ~~0.1.2 - Row Removal~~
    
    * ~~Row's have been removed as the stacking update will simplify what problems rows were intended to solve~~


* ~~0.1.3 - Property Passing~~

    * ~~Properties can be passed to grid instances as a table of property->value pairs~~


* 0.1.4 - Stacking Columns
    
    * Columns whose width, when added onto the rest of the current row, exceed the maximum width of the grid should stack
