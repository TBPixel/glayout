### The Refactoring Update

Grid's have been completely refactored. Method's are now organized both alphabetically and by group.

Grid Math has been extremely simplified, and now functions correctly ( *knocks on wood* ) with few hiccups.


## 0.2.5

### Box Model Fixes

Calculations.lua has been refactored into individual methods that all are called within GridMath.

The :Init() method has been removed in favour of the Grid:Update() method. Remove all :Init() method calls and simply add an :Update() method to your grid instance after all columns are created.

The :AutoUpdateY() method has been replace with a boolean on Grid's. Simply pass autoUpdateY = true to grid, either through property passing or setting it manually, and Grid:Update() will handle it.


## 0.2.4

### Padding Fixes for Grid

More of an oversight than a bug, padding on grids didn't really make sense. If padding were set & a grid was drawn, it had no affect on it's columns.

That's now been fixed. Using padding isn't really useful if Grid isn't going to be drawn to ( it basically acts the same ), but is great if columns should
be spaced from the edges of a Drawn Grid


## 0.2.3

### Auto Update Grid Y

Grid's can now have their Y position automatically updated via the Grid:AutoUpdateY() method.

Due to the calls to :Init() method on both Grid's & Columns, this method is to be used only **AFTER** all your columns are created.

Using this method means you *do not* need to adjust your initial y position for the height of your first row.


## 0.2.2

### BUGFIX: Grid geight not being updated

Grid height wasn't being updated before as the grid instance wasn't being re-initialized.

To prevent repetitious calls to the :Init() method, it's left up to the user to re-initialize after creating their instance.

For the sake of convenience, it will break the rule when updating grid height ( called every time a new column is added ).


## 0.2.1

### BUGFIX: Creating Columns Sequentially

Creating columns using a for loop would cause columns to stack on top of each other, this issue should be fixed.

Creating columns manually are unaffected and stack in the same way.


## 0.2.0

### The Column Stacking Update

Columns now stack into new rows upon exceeding the maximum width of the grid.

Columns will continue to stack indefinitely.

New rows will start their new Y position at the bottom of the tallest item from the previous row to prevent overlap and increase consistency


## 0.1.3

### The Property Passing Update

Properties of grids and columns may now be passed to the instance as a table of propery->value pairs.


## 0.1.2

### The Row Removal Update

Rows have been removed and the spacing system has been reworked to accomadate.
Rows were removed in preparation for The Stacking Columns Updateâ„¢ to come.


## 0.1.1

### The Box Model Update

The box model and it's relevant calculations have been completely re-written.

* Margins now stack and work on all instances of Grids ( Grids, Rows & Columns )
* A new property has been added for content called **[INSTANCE].content.x** & **[INSTANCE].content.y**
* Padding can now be adjusted, and will modify the **content** properties of an instance
* Some sizing & positioning issues were addressed in the Box Model Update
